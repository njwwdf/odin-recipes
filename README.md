# odin-recipes
This exercise created a website linked to recipes.

Basic HMTL features were used to link a page to three of Odin's Favorite Recipes. Each recipe included a unordered list of ingredients and an ordered list of steps. Links to images found on google were used to show what the recipe should look like.
